                    <p><strong>Week 1:</strong> I've been trying to find a way to develop a website. I had in mind that a lot of people were saying that the best method is the old school/simple one. So I started with as simplistic as it gets, basic HTML and CSS. This week, I picked a color palette and worked on the design of the website. I want the user to focus on the task they are doing instead of getting distracted by unnecessary things. So I'll not make the website super fancy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Week 2:</strong> This week I learned that some free hosting websites share the information of the users of the websites the developers make. Since that is exactly what I don't want the users to experience, I started self hosting. This also allowed me to use web technologies like the <Link target='_blank' href='https://qwik.dev/' class="text-sky-500 hover:underline">Qwik</Link> framework. I heard that it's really fast and I want to see how good it actually is.</p>
